  As everyone is aware, 2020 was a challenging year to say the least, but one that also brought us to a new chapter in our lives together.  One night, in the relative calm of the summer, we were enjoying a bonfire in our backyard and decided that the time was right to get married.  Nick proposed to Raechel in mid-December, shortly before the holidays.  While Raechel may have not been completely surprised, we have such great memories from that day.
